# Study 3: The Vibration of Yellow and Purple

## Theoretical Analysis
Yellow and purple form a complementary pair of extraordinary subtlety and vibration. Yellow, the lightest and most advancing of colours, is the very essence of luminosity. Purple, a compound of red and blue, carries both warmth and coolness, making it uniquely capable of deepening shadows while retaining colouristic richness. When placed together, they create a visual oscillation—a “vibration” that enlivens the surface without overwhelming it.

This pair is especially suited to portraiture and intimate interior scenes, where delicate shifts of temperature convey the softness of flesh, the sheen of fabric, and the play of reflected light. The yellow‑purple contrast is less aggressive than red‑green or blue‑orange, allowing for a more nuanced, atmospheric shading.

## Conceptual Painting Description
*A young woman in a lavender dress seated by a window, her face lit by a shaft of morning sun that casts a delicate purple shadow onto her yellow scarf.*
The scene is an interior morning: a figure sits near a window, the light falling across her shoulder and across a yellow silk scarf draped over the back of her chair. The scarf’s bright yellow catches the light, while the folds facing away from the window fall into a soft, lilac‑grey shadow. The woman’s lavender dress picks up the same purple note, its shadows tinged with a warm yellow‑ochre. The background is a neutral grey‑green, allowing the yellow‑purple dialogue to dominate. The painting aims to capture a moment of quiet reflection, where colour itself becomes the vehicle of mood.

## Colour Palette
- **Cadmium Yellow Light** – for the sun‑lit areas of the scarf and the highlights on the skin.
- **Yellow Ochre** – to warm the mid‑tones and to mix with purple for the shadow transitions.
- **French Ultramarine** – the blue component of the purple mixtures.
- **Alizarin Crimson** – the red component of the purple mixtures.
- **Titanium White** – to lighten and to create the delicate lilac tints.
- **Raw Umber** – a neutral dark to anchor the deepest shadows and to grey the purple when needed.

## Mixing the Purple
The character of the purple shadow depends on the ratio of red to blue. For a warm, reddish purple (suitable for flesh shadows), use more Alizarin Crimson. For a cooler, more violet purple (suitable for fabric or atmospheric depth), increase the proportion of Ultramarine. In practice, I premix two purples: a warm purple (2 parts Alizarin, 1 part Ultramarine) and a cool purple (1 part Alizarin, 2 parts Ultramarine). The warm purple is used in the shadows adjacent to yellow; the cool purple is reserved for the receding planes.

## Vibration and Atmosphere
The “vibration” arises from the simultaneous contrast of the two hues. To enhance this effect:
1. **Juxtapose, Do Not Mix**: Place small strokes of pure yellow next to pure purple, allowing the eye to blend them optically.
2. **Glaze Thinly**: Over a dry yellow underlayer, apply a very thin purple glaze. The yellow will glow through, creating a luminous shadow.
3. **Control Saturation**: Keep the purple slightly greyed (by adding a touch of its complement, yellow ochre) to prevent it from becoming too intense and overwhelming the yellow.

## Application in Portraiture
In flesh tones, yellow represents the warm light on the skin, while purple describes the cool halftones and reflected lights. The transition from yellow to purple should be gradual, with intermediate tones mixed from yellow ochre and the warm purple. This produces a convincing volume and a living, breathing quality to the skin.

## Notes on Light Quality
- **Morning Light**: The yellow is clean and crisp, the purple leans toward a cool violet.
- **Evening Light**: The yellow deepens toward gold, the purple warms toward a reddish mauve.
- **Overcast Light**: Both colours become greyer and closer in value; the vibration is subtler, requiring a more restrained palette.

This study demonstrates how yellow and purple, handled with delicacy, can evoke a sense of intimate atmosphere and subtle vibration—a hallmark of the post‑impressionist approach to colour harmony.
