# Study 1: The Calm of Red and Green

## Theoretical Analysis
The complementary pairing of red and green creates a visual harmony that is both vibrant and calming. When used in shading, the reds and greens interact to produce rich, nuanced shadows that avoid the dullness of neutral greys. This complementarity is rooted in the physiological afterimage effect, where the eye, fatigued by red, perceives a greenish tint in adjacent areas, thus enhancing the sensation of depth and volume.

In domestic scenes, this pair evokes a sense of quietude and intimacy. The warmth of red—whether in fabrics, wood, or skin tones—is subtly cooled by green shadows, establishing a balanced atmosphere that feels both lived-in and serene.

## Conceptual Painting Description
*A woman reading by a window, with the red of her book cover casting subtle greenish shadows onto the page.*
The scene is set in a sunlit parlour. The morning light streams through a lace curtain, illuminating the red leather binding of the book she holds. As the light wraps around the book, the shadows it casts onto the white pages and her hands take on a delicate greenish hue. The wall behind her is a pale ochre, but in the shadowed folds of her dress, a muted viridian emerges. This interplay captures a moment of peaceful concentration, where the complementary colours silently reinforce the quiet mood.

## Colour Palette
- **Alizarin Crimson** – for the rich, warm red of the book cover and the rosy glow of her cheeks.
- **Viridian** – for the cool green shadows on the pages and in the drapery.
- **Yellow Ochre** – for the sun‑lit wall and the highlights on the lace.
- **Titanium White** – to lighten and modulate the mixtures.
- **Raw Umber** – a touch in the deepest shadows to anchor the composition.

## Variations in Red Pigments
The choice of red pigment influences the character of the green shadow. A warmer red, such as Cadmium Red, produces a shadow that tends toward a more olive, earthy green. A cooler red like Alizarin Crimson yields a cleaner, more transparent green, closer to a true viridian. In practice, I often layer both: Cadmium Red for the sun‑lit areas and Alizarin Crimson for the deeper, transparent shadows, thus creating a richer interplay of temperatures within the same complementary pair.

## Notes on Saturation
The saturation of the Viridian must be adjusted according to the quality of light. In the strong, direct sunlight of the South of France, the green can be more intense and opaque. Indoors, under diffused northern light, it should be glazed thinly, allowing the underlying warmth to show through, creating a more subtle vibration.

Additionally, the intensity of southern French sunlight amplifies the contrast between light and shadow, making the green shadows appear more vivid and distinct. In northern interiors, the softer light reduces contrast, requiring a more muted, greyed‑green mixture to maintain the same sense of quiet harmony.
